# Singularity Shift - Black Hole Puzzle Game

A black hole-themed 3D puzzle adventure game where players manipulate spacetime to solve puzzles and navigate through a mysterious labyrinth.

## 🎮 Game Concept

**Singularity Shift** challenges players to think with physics as they control gravity, time, and space to guide light through 3D mazes towards the ultimate goal - reaching the Singularity.

### Key Features
- **Gravity Manipulation**: Use gravity lenses to bend space and redirect objects
- **Time Control**: Create time bubbles to slow down or accelerate time
- **Spatial Warping**: Rotate and distort the environment to create new paths
- **Physics-Based Puzzles**: Solve increasingly complex puzzles using realistic physics

## 🔫 Portal Demo

A minimal Portal-style level is available using Phaser. After installing
dependencies, run `npm run dev` and open the browser at the provided URL.
Use the arrow keys to move the player. Left-click places a blue portal and
right-click places an orange portal. Walking through one portal teleports you
to the other. Reach the yellow square to win.
